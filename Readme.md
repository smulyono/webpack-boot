# Webpack Boot 

Simple webpack build generator which is inspired and derived some of the utility from `react-scripts`. 

The key goal for webpack boot is to automate the configuration of webpack based on the module `needs` (automatically derived the module `needs` from their dependencies), without worry-ing what kind of configuration needs to go in to the webpack configuration. Similar as `react-scripts` which is to shift the focus on the code / application rather than the dev tools configuration needed. 

## How to get started
